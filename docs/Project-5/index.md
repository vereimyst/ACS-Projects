# Project #5: Approximate Computing Logic Design (Final Project)
### Due date: Dec. 5

## Introduction
Investigate logic circuits optimized for approximate computations, where slight inaccuracies are acceptable for significant energy or speed gains.

## Requirement
Presentation 40%, GitHub 60%. Your presentation (~12 mins) should clearly show why you do it, what you have done, and key results/analysis. On your Github site, readers should easily understand what you have done and your code structure, and see all the code and detailed results/analysis.

Again, post all your code, README, report, and analysis on your GitHub site.
